# Team-Profile-Generator-HW-10

# Description
Inquirer is an easily integrated and beautiful command line interface for Node.js that provides user interface and query session flow to create different forms and Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any codebase. 

In this project, we build a Team-Profile generator using Javascript and Node.js. The app creates from scratch a website, containing multiple members of a team, just by typing the information on "the terminal". Once the website is generated, the output information will be deployed on an index.html file.
